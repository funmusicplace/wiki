# Fun Music Place Wiki

This is an MKDocs documentation site using the mkdocs-material plugin. It builds to the `gh-pages` branch using GitHub Actions.

## Editing the wiki locally

Check out the MKDocs documentation [to get it installed](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/). 

The site uses the [Material for MkDocs theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) and the [MkDocs Blogging plugin](https://liang2kl.github.io/mkdocs-blogging-plugin/) so they also need to be installed for the site to render properly. 

On Linux and MacOS:
```
pip install mkdocs-material
pip3 install mkdocs-blogging-plugin
```
Check the documentation for instructions to install on other systems (like Windows). 

Then clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:funmusicplace/wiki.git
cd wiki
mkdocs serve
```
This generates a local preview of the website which can be viewed your web browser of choice.
